 
DATA VARIABLES 

"features": from 'features.txt' (List of all features), where data only related to means & standard deviations is extracted. 
"train" : 'train/X_train.txt'(Training set). 
"ytrain" : 'train/y_train.txt'(Training labels). 
"test : 'test/X_test.txt'(Test set). 
"ytest" : 'test/y_test.txt' (Test labels). 
"subtrain" : subject_train.txt (Indicates which subject in training set performed particular activity).   
"subtest" : subject_test.txt (Indicates which subject in training set performed particular activity). 


ACTIVITY VARIABLES:
(describes the six different types of activities that the subjects performed), 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING 


EXPLANATION OF DATA (from the README.TXT) 
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."
