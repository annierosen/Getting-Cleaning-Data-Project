# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Project
Coursera Project
This script collects and combines data from a UCI dataset containing information on wearable computing data. 
The script does as follows: 
1) provides names for all datasets
2) merges the relevant data into one dataframe 
3) isolates the dataframe for 'feature' data only related to mean & standard deviation
4) relabels the 'activities' data for each activity and relabels the 'features' columns properly 
5) creates a new dataframe for the averages of each 'feature' on mean & standard deviation across each activity & subject
